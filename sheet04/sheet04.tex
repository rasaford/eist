        Coupling measures the dependency between different subsystems inside a project.
        High coupling therefore implies that changes to one subsystem will have a large impact on 
        another subsystem.
        Low coupling on the other hand means that, a change in one subsystem does not affect others. 

        Cohesion describes the dependency among two classes. 
        Therefore high cohesion describes a subsystem where the classes perform similar tasks and 
        are related to each other in many associations.
        Low cohesion is the inverse of the above. A subsystem with many classes that handle very different
        tasks and have few to no associations with each other.

        These terms can be used to describe a good system design, as a good system should have 
        high cohesion and low coupling between the different submodules.

        An Example of this would be the \textit{car} package in the Bumpers game. Here Cohesion is used between 
        the different car types in the form of inheritance. This provides a close relationship between the 
        different objects and ensures that the participating classes are concerned with only a single 
        purpose, the details of modeling a car.

        A low coupling is then used to connects this \textit{car} package to the other subsystems of the game.
